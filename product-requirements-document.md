## Introduction

We are building an increasingly dynamic hub of information, a living record of activity, and a beacon for international, public sector open-source collaboration, which will grow as a gateway to a rich and varied ecosystem of ideas, resources, and communities.

This document gathers our previous learnings and experiences, as well as our desires and goals, into a central resource and idea hub for the evolution of [publiccode.net](https://publiccode.net).

Publiccode.net must embody the [Foundation for Public Code communications principles](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/communication/communication-principles.html).

### Mid-priority
