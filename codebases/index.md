# Codebases we work with

The Foundation for Public Code helps to effectively scale codebases. We do this by supporting ambitious communities with [codebase stewardship](../codebase-stewardship/index.html).

Codebases are organized by [codebase maturity](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/lifecycle.html).

## Assessment

In this phase, codebase communities and the Foundation for Public Code decide if:

* the codebase is a good fit for Foundation stewardship
* Foundation stewardship will meet the community's goals and ambitions

These codebases are currently in public assessment:

There are currently no codebases being assesed for Foundation stewardship.

## Incubation

Codebases in incubation are working to meet the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/).

These codebases are currently in incubation:

* [OpenZaak](openzaak.md): backend component to help municipalities manage and share data internally
* [Signalen](signalen.md/): receiving, automatically classifying and prioritising residentsâ€™ nuisance reports

## Mature

Mature codebases and communities fully meet the Standard for Public Code.

There are currently no mature codebases under Foundation stewardship.
